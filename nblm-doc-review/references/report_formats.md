**Example:**
```markdown
## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Updates

1. **Add Transaction Monitoring Thresholds**
   - **Issue:** Policy lacks specific dollar thresholds for digital asset monitoring
   - **Action:** Add section specifying $1,000 threshold for Travel Rule compliance and identity verification requirements
   - **Reference:** POCR Regulation 10, BMA DAB Guidance Section 4.2
   - **Impact:** Non-compliance may result in regulatory sanctions and inability to detect structuring/smurfing

2. **Define Blockchain Analysis Procedures**
   - **Issue:** No mention of blockchain tracing or high-risk source detection
   - **Action:** Add procedures for monitoring transfers to/from mixing services, dark web marketplaces, and sanctioned addresses
   - **Reference:** BMA DAB Guidance, Transaction Monitoring Requirements
   - **Impact:** Critical for detecting illicit fund flows and meeting risk-based monitoring obligations

### Priority 2: Important Enhancements

3. **Expand Real-Time Sanctions Screening**
   - **Issue:** Policy mentions screening but lacks detail on real-time transaction screening
   - **Action:** Specify that all transactions must be screened against HM Treasury Consolidated List before execution
   - **Reference:** International Sanctions Regulations 2013, BMA Guidance Chapter 8
   - **Impact:** Reduces risk of sanctions violations and regulatory penalties

### Priority 3: Best Practice Improvements

4. **Add Wallet Address Screening Protocol**
   - **Issue:** Generic screening language doesn't address blockchain-specific requirements
   - **Action:** Add section on wallet address screening including on-chain risk scoring
   - **Reference:** BMA DAB Guidance, Enhanced Due Diligence section
   - **Impact:** Enhances ability to detect high-risk counterparties in digital asset transactions
